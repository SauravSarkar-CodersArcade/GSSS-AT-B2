Problem Statement:
Demonstrate the use of 'new' and 'delete' keywords in C++
by initializing an array with the size dynamically allocated
and then by freeing the memory.

Problem statement: HackerEarth March 2023 Wipro
Create a const pointer function which will take a
character input from the user and based on that it will
recommend some food to the user.
Constraint:
1. The first letter will correspond to the food
that is suggested by the function.
Example: 'a' -> "Apple", etc.
2. The function name can be: RecommendMeSomeFood()

Problem Statement:
Rotate an array in the clockwise direction by one position.
Input array: {1,2,3,4,5}

Problem Statement:
HackerEarth: March 2023, Accenture
Given an array of integers, and a given sum variable(x), check whether
that sum is actually present in any consecutive pair in the array.
Display 'Yes' or 'No' based on the comparison in the result.
Constraints: 0 <= N <= 100

Problem Statement:
Given an array, display the maximum in the array till n-th term
as the output array.
Sample input:  0 -1  2 -4  6
Sample Output: 0  0  2  2  6
Important Interview Questions in C++
Q. Generic Function:
Problem Statement: Create a generic function in C++
using swap algorithm to swap any data type given to the function.
a = 10
b = 20
c = 'a'
d = 'b'
Q. Generic Pointer
Problem Statement:
Create a function with a void pointer which can point to
any kind of pointer based on the target character provided by
the user, and provide the proper value in that respective
data type.
Note: The void pointer should be type casted to that particular
data type based on the user input (argument) passed in the
function call.

Q. Function Pointer:
What is a function pointer?
Syntax:
return_type (*ptr) (t1,t2....,tn) = function_name;

Q. Unique Pointer
A unique pointer is a 1-1 relationship between a pointer(p)
and it's allocated object in the heap (new int).
p owns the object and has only one owner 'p';
If we need a different owner, we have to use the move() function.
** A unique pointer cannot be passed by value.
Header File #inclue <memory>
It is used for fast applications. The memory is auto-deleted.

Object Oriented Programming:
Problem Statement 1:
Create a class Employee with the following attributes:
Name, Company, Age;
Create a method called employeeDetails() to display all
the attributes.
Constraint: Don't create a constructor.

Encapsulation:
The process of making the data members of a class private so that
they cannot be accidentally modified from outside the class is called
encapsulation. The private data members can be accessed outside the class
using special public functions called 'setters' & 'getters'.

Or, Binding the code and the data members inside a block so that they
are not accidentally modified is called encapsulation.

Example: College bag, capsule, Letter inside envelope, etc.

Problem Statement:
Create an Equilateral Triangle class which has a friend class(Triangle) and a
friend function(PrintResults) to calculate the area, perimeter of the triangle.

 * Provide attributes : name, availablePaper
 * Create a parameterised constructor to take the given values from the user
 * If the printer can print the length of the textDocument divided 10 / page,
 * demonstrate how you will handle exceptions
 * if the printer runs out of Paper in all the possible ways.

Problem Statement:
Implement a Binary Tree using a class as per the given diagram.
Also, make the constructor explicit so that it can avoid/restrict
abnormal changes to the data.
Constraints: After using the memory, deallocate the memory for all the
respective nodes.

Given three different dynamic arrays, find the common element in
these three arrays by using the StandardTemplateLibrary-Vector Data Structure.

Problem Statement:
Hacker Earth: 15th June 2023 Accenture
Implement a StandardTemplateLibrary::Map & UnorderedMap
to take the key:value pair <"State":"Language"> and insert the
respective states and their corresponding languages in the map.

Illustrate the use of "map with list of strings" to store
the names of students and their favourite food in a list,
which will be inserted into a map.

Also, iterate over the map to display the data in each
row in a single line.
